This Sales Dashboard provides a clean, data-driven snapshot of e-commerce performance, built in a professional dark-blue theme for high readability. It highlights revenue, product trends, seasonality, customer metrics, and geographic insights using intuitive visuals and KPIs.

## What the dashboard reveals: 
- Total Revenue 
- Total Sales on discounts and promotions 
- Total Sales by Category 
- Top 10 most selling products 
- Seasonal Sales Index
- Active Customers (customer with active subscription)
- Average Rating from the customer 
- Least 5 States by Sales

## What I notice:
- Sales made during promotions is 40%+ of the total sales 
- Sales accross all season are almost equal 
- Clothing category made up of 44%+ of the total Sales 
- 27% of the total customers are active customers
- Most customers give over 3.5 rating points 

## Recommendation:
- Giving of discount and bonuses will increase the sales, increase the percentage of the active customers and also earn higher rating points 
- Investing more into the clothing category of the company will increase the turnover
- Low-performing states (e.g., Hawaii, Florida) need localized strategies.

### Tools used: Likely Excel, SQL and Power BI.
